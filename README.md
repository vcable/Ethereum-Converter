**What is this?**
This is my first live website, and first real side project.  This webapp is a simple converter for Ether and its various units.
I know there are already multiple websites that do this better, but I wanted to work on a fun personal project and learn a little about web hosting in the process.  

**What did I learn from building this?**
I've been coding since June 2019, and besides several careless mistakes that cost me a couple hours, this was a fairly easy project.  I used a Javascript library called Ethereumjs-Units, which took care of most of the work.  The main lesson that I took away from this project was that I really need to work on my DOM manipulation skills, since that is where I ran into the most difficulties.
